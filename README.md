# ICBHI-RR-labels
To our knowledge, this is the first time the ICBHI database (https://bhichallenge.med.auth.gr/) has been labeled for the task of RR estimation. For this purpose, we analyzed all the ICBHI files and selected those from patients whose respiratory rate could be estimated either acoustically or through visual inspection of spectrograms. Additionally, if a patient had multiple auscultations, only one was randomly selected. Consequently, we selected a subset of 71 patients in total, comprising 50 normal patients, 7 patients with only wheezing, 12 patients with only crackles, and 2 patients with both crackles and wheezing simultaneously, according to the metadata provided by ICBHI. Regarding the labeling process, we provide the web link where the .txt file with the selected subset of files and the manually labeled respiratory rate can be found. In this .txt file, each row contains the file name in the first column and the manually labeled respiratory rate, in breaths per minute, in the second column.
